# With an empty nodeSelector, there’s no restriction on which nodes the pod can run on. We can later add key/value
# pairs here to schedule the pod on nodes that match specific labels.
# nodeSelector: { }

# An empty list means the pod won’t tolerate any taints by default. Tolerations allow pods to be scheduled on
# nodes that have specific taints, so without any defined, the pod will only run on nodes without conflicting taints.
# tolerations: [ ]

#An empty affinity block means there are no rules set for pod or node affinity/anti-affinity. These rules can be used
# to influence pod placement (for example, to keep certain pods together or apart), but here none are applied.
